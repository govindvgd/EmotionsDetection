# Emotion Detection Using Convolutional Neural Networks

This repository contains code for emotion detection using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) with TensorFlow and OpenCV. The model is trained on a dataset of facial expressions to recognize emotions such as anger, happiness, sadness, etc., in real-time using a webcam.

## Dependencies

- Python 3.11
- TensorFlow
- OpenCV
- NumPy

## Usage Instructions

1. Clone this repository.
2. Install the required dependencies (`numpy`, `opencv-python`, `tensorflow`).
3. Run the `main.py` script.
4. The webcam will open, and you will see real-time emotion detection on your face.
